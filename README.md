🤖 Cross‑Domain Transfer Learning: From Human Motion to Robot Fault Detection
A machine learning pipeline that leverages human motion data to detect robot joint faults using LSTM‑based residual models and transfer learning.

🧠 Project Overview
This project trains a Long Short‑Term Memory (LSTM) residual model on human motion sequences, then transfers that learned representation to detect faults in robotic joints. By mapping robot sensor features into a human‑motion–like feature space and fine‑tuning selectively, the system adapts to robot fault detection tasks effectively.

🚀 Key Features
LSTM Residual Network to capture temporal structure in motion/fault data.

Transfer Learning Pipeline:

Train on human motion data.

Map robot features into the learned human-motion feature space.

Freeze early layers of the network for fine-tuning on robot data.

Training Enhancements: Class weighting, callbacks, and feature‑importance evaluation to improve model robustness and interpretability.

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Subhash-777/Cross-Domain-transfer-learning-from-Human-Motion-to-Robot-Fault-Detection.git
cd Cross-Domain-transfer-learning-from-Human-Motion-to-Robot-Fault-Detection
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare the Data
Ensure your human motion data and robot sensor logs are formatted appropriately:

Human motion sequences for training.

Robot joint data for fine‑tuning.
Follow the patterns in the example notebook for preprocessing and feature alignment.

4. Train the Model
Use the Jupyter notebook or command‑line scripts to train the LSTM model on human data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
5. Transfer & Fine‑Tune for Fault Detection
Map robot data into the human-motion feature space, freeze early layers, and fine‑tune on robot dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python fine_tune.py
6. Evaluate & Analyze
Evaluate model performance and analyze feature importance:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate.py
🔍 How It Works
Preprocessing: Clean and format sequential data from both domains.

Feature Adaptation: Transform robot sensor data to align with the human-motion embedding space.

Residual-LSTM Model: Capture temporal dynamics while leveraging residual connections.

Transfer Learning: Freeze lower-level weights and fine-tune upper layers on robot fault detection.

Training Enhancements: Use callbacks, class weights, and visualization tools for better training and diagnostics.
